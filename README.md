### WORKFLOW:
+ **window manager:** dwm [(my custom build)](https://github.com/akai-hana/suckless/)
+ **distro:** Chimera Linux
> I really like the structural choices this distro takes.
> It's independent like Void or Gentoo, and it combinates the Linux kernel + *BSD userland, musl + mimalloc, Alpine's apk (v3 instead of Alpine's production v2). 
> [Here](https://chimera-linux.org/)'s more about them.
